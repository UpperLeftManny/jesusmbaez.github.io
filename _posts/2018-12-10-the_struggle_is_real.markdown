WHEW. 

The first few weeks of Flatiron's Online Software Engineering program has been a whirlwind. 

I started off strong since I got pretty far into the pre-work. I got pretty sick (Thanks Celiac!) about a week after we started and fell behind. I was already struggling to memorize and absorb some of the concepts. I'm such a visual learner and I need to see it done and explained I think. I've veered off into video tutorials and working in my Treehouse account trying to get a better undstanding of Ruby. I will be behind for a bit in the actual coursework but 

The truth: I can code along with the lessons and feel like I am getting it. But when it comes to actually doing it on my own during a lab, I blank out. 

I'm still behind and struggling but I refuse to give up. 

Fighting!
